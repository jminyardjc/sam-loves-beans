# sam-loves-beans

I was supposed to go visit family over the Thanksgiving holiday but got sick and
had to cancel, so I decided to play around and learn a little Go.

I have a collegue who LOVES beans. So I built this site dedicated to him and
beans.

Cheers 🍻, Sam

This is my first project in Go and as such it is super hacky, so I'm sure there
is a lot of room for improvement...
